        <li>Rose is so amazing, unique and one of the loveliest flower among any other kinds of flower.</li>
        <li>Rose is a beautiful flower yet it has thorns and it reminds me that not every beautiful things are perfect.</li>
        <li>Rose is a very special flower and since my name has rose in it, for me that makes me special as well.</li>
